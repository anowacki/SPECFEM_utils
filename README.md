About
-----

This repo contains scripts for running [`SPECFEM3D_GLOBE`](https://github.com/geodynamics/specfem3d_globe)
on a few different HPC machines.  It automatically works out which version of `SPECFEM3D_GLOBE` you're using, and one what machine, and creates job scripts and Par_files accordingly.
